## Getting Started

There are a few basic examples that are ready for you to run. You can find them in the [samples directory](samples/README.md). If you want to jump straight to your favorite language, you can find the examples in the following directories:

- [JavaScript](samples/js/README.md)
- [Python](samples/python/README.md)
- [cURL](samples/curl/README.md)

If you are already familiar with the GitHub Models service, you can start by running our Cookbook examples. You can find them in the [cookbooks directory](cookbooks/README.md). Here are the direct links to the available languages (at this point only Python):

- [Python](cookbooks/python/README.md)
